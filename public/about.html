<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kartikeya Mishra, I'm an 19 year old Musician from
  Mumbai, India. I make music revolving around my feelings, whether
  that be something sad, happy or any other kind of emotion. I just want
  my songs to be a true reflection of how I felt when I wrote it. My music
  is like a personal diary for me capturing important moments and
  feelings. The way I portray my feelings in my songs could be
  interpreted differently to different people as to what I thought while
  making the song, and that's what makes music so beautiful!

<p>I hope you got a gist of who I am and what my beliefs are, hope to see you be a
  part of my journey.
